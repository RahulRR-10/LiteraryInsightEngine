Once upon a time, in the ancient kingdom of Ayodhya, ruled a wise and just king named **Dasharatha**. He had four sons, the most beloved being **Rama**, the eldest, born to Queen **Kaushalya**. Rama was known for his righteousness, valor, and devotion to dharma (duty). His wife, **Sita**, was the daughter of King Janaka and was as virtuous as she was beautiful.

Dasharatha decided to crown Rama as the heir to the throne. However, Queen **Kaikeyi**, influenced by her maid **Manthara**, reminded the king of a promise he once made to her. She demanded that her son, **Bharata**, be made king instead, and that Rama be sent into exile for 14 years. Bound by his word, Dasharatha reluctantly agreed, heartbroken by the decision.

Ever obedient, Rama willingly accepted the exile, despite the pain it caused him. His devoted wife Sita, and his loyal brother **Lakshmana**, insisted on accompanying him into the forest. The three of them lived in the wilderness for many years, facing numerous trials.

During their exile, the demon king **Ravana** of Lanka, captivated by Sita’s beauty, kidnapped her and took her to his kingdom. Rama, determined to rescue Sita, sought help from the **Vanara** (monkey) king **Sugriva** and his general **Hanuman**. Hanuman, with his extraordinary strength and devotion, leapt across the ocean to Lanka, found Sita, and reassured her that Rama would soon come to save her.

With the help of Sugriva’s army, Rama built a bridge across the sea and waged a fierce battle against Ravana’s forces. After a heroic fight, Rama slew Ravana and rescued Sita. They returned to Ayodhya after completing the 14 years of exile, where Bharata, who had ruled in Rama’s absence, joyfully returned the crown to his elder brother.

Rama was crowned king, and his reign, known as **Rama Rajya**, became a golden era of peace, prosperity, and justice. Thus, the Ramayana remains a timeless tale of love, duty, courage, and righteousness.
