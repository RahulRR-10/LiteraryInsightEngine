This research paper titled "A Rāmāyaṇa of Their Own: Women's Oral Tradition in Telugu" explores the existence and importance of women's versions of Rāmāyaṇa in Telugu, India. The main objective is to document these oral traditions and understand their significance in the context of gender and literary studies. The research questions include understanding the differences between women's versions of Rāmāyaṇa and the standard versions, analyzing the themes present in women's Rāmāyaṇa, and identifying the techniques used by women storytellers. 

The key methodology employed is ethnographic fieldwork involving interviews, observations, and recordings of women storytellers and their performances. The paper also draws on previous studies on the Rāmāyaṇa tradition in Telugu and oral traditions in general. 

The principal findings of the paper are that there is a rich tradition of women's Rāmāyaṇa in Telugu, which differs significantly from the standard versions. These versions prioritize themes such as women's perspectives, emotions, and experiences, and often portray Sītā, the female protagonist, as a strong and independent character. The paper also identifies the distinct techniques used by women storytellers, such as the use of songs and humor to engage the audience. 

The major conclusion drawn from this research is that women's versions of Rāmāyaṇa in Telugu form a significant aspect of literary and cultural traditions and offer a unique perspective on the story, which is often overlooked in the standard versions. The paper highlights the importance of documenting and preserving these oral traditions and providing a platform for women's voices and experiences in the literary world.
