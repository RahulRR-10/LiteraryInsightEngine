The main objective of this research paper is to develop a solar-powered water purifier that provides affordable and safe drinking water. The paper aims to address the problem of water contamination and scarcity in many parts of Bangladesh through renewable solar energy. The methodology used involves the integration of solar panels and a purification system for removing contaminants and pollutants from water sources. The purification process includes reverse osmosis, UV sterilization, or distillation. The solar-powered water purifier aims to provide a sustainable solution that is environmentally friendly and independent of grid power, making it ideal for remote and off-grid locations. The principal findings of the study indicate that the solar-powered water purifier is effective in removing impurities, pathogens, and contaminants from water sources, making it safe for consumption. The major conclusion of the study is that the use of renewable solar energy can provide affordable and safe drinking water in areas where traditional infrastructure may be lacking or unreliable, thus improving the quality of life for the communities affected.
