The objective of this research paper is to develop a solar-powered water purifier that can provide safe and affordable drinking water to areas facing water scarcity and contamination issues, such as Bangladesh. The study aims to answer the following research questions: how can a solar-powered water purifier effectively remove impurities and pathogens from contaminated water sources? What are the benefits of utilizing renewable solar energy for water purification, and how can this technology improve access to safe drinking water?

The key methodology used in this research is the development and testing of a solar-powered water purifier prototype. The system combines solar panels to harness and convert solar energy into electricity and a purification system to remove contaminants and impurities from water sources. The water purification process involves filtration and disinfection methods such as reverse osmosis, UV sterilization, or distillation, which ensures the water meets safety standards for human consumption. The system also includes inlet and reserve tanks, microcontrollers, and a waste water system.

The principal findings of this study show that a solar-powered water purifier is a sustainable solution for providing clean drinking water that addresses the challenges of water contamination and scarcity. The system can effectively remove impurities, pathogens, and pollutants from water, ensuring that it meets the required quality standards for consumption, making it an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution compared to traditional infrastructure that may be lacking or unreliable in remote or off-grid locations.

The major conclusion drawn from this study is that solar-powered water purifiers can significantly improve access to safe drinking water, especially in areas with water scarcity and contamination issues. The study recommends further research to improve the efficiency and affordability of the technology to make it accessible to more communities globally.
