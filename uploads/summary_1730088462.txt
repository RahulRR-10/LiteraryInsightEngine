This research paper provides a comprehensive summary of the state of the art of quantum computing for financial applications. The main objective is to describe how quantum solutions, adapted to work on quantum computers, can potentially help to solve financial problems more efficiently and accurately in areas such as derivative pricing, risk modeling, portfolio optimization, natural language processing, and fraud detection. The key methodology of the paper is a literature review of research articles, patents, and other publicly available sources related to quantum computing and finance. The principal findings of the paper are that quantum computing has the potential to surpass the computational capabilities of classical computers in finance and that finance is estimated to be the first industry sector to benefit from quantum computing, even in the short term. The major conclusion of the paper is that quantum computing for finance is a rapidly developing field that can provide solutions for complex financial problems that are not feasible on classical computers. The paper also discusses the feasibility of these algorithms on near-term quantum computers with various hardware implementations and aims to serve as a reference for academic researchers and industry practitioners while inspiring new ideas for future research.
