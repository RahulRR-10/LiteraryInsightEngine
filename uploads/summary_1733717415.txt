The research paper aims to present a method for undertaking structured literature reviews in accounting studies. Such reviews provide a way for scholars to examine a corpus of scholarly literature to develop insights, critical reflections, future research paths, and research questions. The paper outlines ten steps for developing an SLR, which requires tests based on qualitative and quantitative methods. SLRs provide an approach that can help researchers discover under-investigated topics and methods, potentially nurturing the development of new knowledge areas and research approaches. The authors advocate the use of the SLR method, especially for higher-degree research students and emerging scholars, to develop robust and defensible research agendas and questions in accounting studies. The paper is original and provides accounting researchers with an opportunity to develop insightful and publishable studies and serves as a basis for developing future research agendas in the field.
