This research paper proposes an automatic task scheduling scheme based on deep learning and reinforcement learning to optimize large-scale cloud computing. The objectives of the study are to use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning to solve the automated task scheduling for large-scale cloud computing systems. The study employed deep learning technology to monitor and predict the parameters in the cloud computing system in real-time to obtain the system status information. Then, the task scheduling strategy is dynamically adjusted, combined with a reinforcement learning algorithm, according to the real-time system state and task characteristics to achieve the optimal utilization of system resources and the maximum of task execution efficiency. The research findings verify the performance advantages of the proposed scheme in experiments, proving the potential and application prospect of deep learning and reinforcement learning in automatic task scheduling in large-scale cloud computing systems. The primary conclusion of the study is deep learning and reinforcement techniques can enhance Kubernetes Automated Scheduling for large-scale cloud computing optimization effectively.
