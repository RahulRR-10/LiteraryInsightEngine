The main objective of this research paper is to present a method for conducting a structured literature review (SLR) in accounting studies. The authors argue that SLRs are essential for examining a corpus of scholarly literature in order to develop insights, critical reflections, future research paths, and research questions. They outline ten steps for developing an SLR and explain how SLRs offer less bias and more transparency than traditional literature reviews, potentially leading to robust and defensible research agendas and questions. The methodology involves tests based on qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as measures and techniques of validation and reliability. The authors advocate the SLR method for emerging scholars and higher degree research students to develop insightful and publishable studies, and to help discover under-investigated topics and methods in accounting studies. The major conclusion of the paper is that SLRs provide an opportunity for scholars to stand "on the shoulders of giants" and offer impactful research that is different from traditional authorship approaches to literature reviews.
