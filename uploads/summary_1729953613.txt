The objective of this research paper is to propose and implement a scheme for preparing a high-fidelity magic state, which is necessary for running large-scale algorithms on a quantum computer. The researchers aim to produce better magic states using error correction than those that can be prepared using individual qubits and to increase the yield of magic states using adaptive circuits. The key methodology involves using error correction to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits and processing noisy input magic states with fault-tolerant distillation circuits. The principal findings of the study show that the proposed scheme produces higher quality magic states than those that can be prepared using individual qubits and that the yield of magic states can be increased using adaptive circuits. The major conclusion is that error correction can be used to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits and reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures. The proposed scheme will be valuable in the future for reducing the cost of magic-state distillation schemes and improving the fidelity of input states.
