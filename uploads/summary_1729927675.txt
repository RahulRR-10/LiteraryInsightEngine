This research paper focuses on the development of a solar-powered water purifier to provide safe and affordable drinking water. The main objective is to provide a sustainable solution to the challenges of water contamination and scarcity in Bangladesh by harnessing solar energy to power the water purification process. The key methodology involves combining solar panels with a purification system that removes impurities and pollutants from water sources. The principal finding is that solar-powered water purifiers offer an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution that can operate independently of grid power in remote or off-grid locations. Key purification methods include reverse osmosis, UV sterilization, and distillation. The major conclusion is that solar-powered water purifiers can effectively address the critical issue of access to safe drinking water, particularly in areas where traditional infrastructure is lacking or unreliable.
