This research paper investigates the local kinematics of K and M giants by analyzing data from the CORAVEL, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 catalogs. The study aims to revisit the concept of superclusters by examining the velocity fields of giant stars in the solar neighborhood. The researchers use a combination of proper motion and radial velocity data to determine the kinematics of the stars. The principal findings reveal the existence of a complex velocity field in the solar neighborhood, including structures previously identified as superclusters. The authors suggest that these superclusters may not be distinct physical entities, but instead represent velocity fluctuations within the Milky Way galaxy. The study concludes that further analysis of kinematic data can provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way galaxy.
